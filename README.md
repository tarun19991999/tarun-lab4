# Fish Market Prediction Model

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict attributes of fish using the Fish Market dataset. The model can either predict the weight of a fish (regression problem) or classify the species of a fish (classification problem). This project is deployed using a Flask API and is accessible through a simple web interface.

## Description

This project leverages machine learning to predict fish characteristics. The Fish Market dataset, available on Kaggle, is used to train the model. The goal is to predict the weight of the fish or classify the fish species based on various attributes like length, height, and width.

### Features:
- **Predict Fish Weight (Regression)**: Given the fish’s length, height, and width, the model will predict the weight of the fish.
- **Classify Fish Species (Classification)**: Based on the same attributes, the model classifies the fish into different species.

The model is deployed as a Flask API and includes a simple frontend interface for users to input values and receive predictions.

## Model Used

- **Type**: Regression / Classification (depending on the problem you choose to solve)
- **Algorithm**: Various machine learning models can be used, such as:
  - Linear Regression (for regression tasks)
  - Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (for classification tasks)

The model is saved as a `.pkl` file and served using Flask.

## Problem Statement

We are tasked with predicting the weight of a fish based on attributes like length, height, and width (for a regression model) or classifying the species of a fish based on the same attributes (for a classification model).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Fish Market Dataset:**
   - Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market) and place the CSV file (`fish-market.csv`) in the project directory.

## Usage

### 1. Train the Machine Learning Model
- Open the `model_training.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and run all the cells to train the model using the Fish Market dataset.

### 2. Serve the Model with Flask
- After training the model, run the Flask API:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- This will start a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 3. Frontend Interface
- Open a web browser and go to the following URL:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5000
  ```
- Input the required attributes (e.g., length, height, width) to get the prediction.

### 4. Testing API
- You can also test the API using Postman by sending a `POST` request to:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
  ```
  - Include the input parameters (e.g., length, height, width) in the request body.
